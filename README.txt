TROUBLESHOOTING
If you don't see data in the pages, make sure you don't have an IP restriction set up for your Qualys account, which would limit you to accessing the Qualys API only from IP addresses set up for your account.  If this restriction is in place, then you need to make sure to run Scantronitor from a network that access to the Qualys API.
